# RGno
Hyperbolic tessellations of the Poincare Disk using DirectX D3D11 on Windows 10. 
This is a complete C++ project for Microsoft Visual Studio 17 to build a UWP DirectX application targeting Windows 10. 

Much of the mathematics behind the hyperbolic geometry in this project is based upon work by Arnaud Cheritat (a universal cover of the Klein Quartic in javascript) which can be found on the web. 

This Visual Studio project has a dependency on The Microsoft DirectXTK library. You must install Microsoft DirectXTK for Windows 10 
x64 prior to building the RGno project in Visual Studio 2017.
